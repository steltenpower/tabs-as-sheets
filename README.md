*For every sheet a browsertab is awesome, but needs improvement*

Use the living web as your sheets ...

In Firefox (unless blocked by sysadmin) in settings you can "Use current pages" for setting the browser 'homepage". It then saves them as one pipe-separated 'URL' that you can then send to someone to set in their browser settings.
This is not the most gentle user-friendly solution. How to improve? With a browser extension, possibly at some point turned into standard Firefox functionality?

Could the wireless clicker people use to go through their Powerpoint sheets also be used to go through browser tabs? As wireless clickers are just wireless keyboards within the receiving device reactions can be adjusted, for example by <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/misc/Remap.htm#Remap">re-mapping keys with AutoHotKeys</a>

Can you stop the reload on switch-to-tab that sometimes happens? (as that would wreck you presentation on internet-hiccup)

Same question for

<pre> data:text/html, <html contenteditable> </pre>

type of content

and can you have a save-to-URL after editing ?

Can https://codepo8.github.io/pastebinzero/ help ?

And can we do something about all those stupid cookie popups? What's that clean reading mode called again?
Maybe save your presentation as a browser in a VirtualMachine-image?

And in settings uncheck "Ctrl+Tab cycles through tabs in recently used order"

Maybe auto-generate an extra sheet for every sheet with a new show-referrer-big.io?url=......

Auto-generate a quick&dirty Powerpoint, as second best.

Many browsers have functionality to save all open browsertabs in a bookmark folder and in some browsers you can then select all bookmarks there and copy the URLs at once.

Use tab title for numbering?

Add a request to Vivaldi, a web browser high on tab functionality: https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/85259/presenting-tabs-as-if-powerpoint-sheets where replies already give useful ingredients
